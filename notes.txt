If you're using VSCode as your code editor and you 
encounter an "expression expected, 
syntax error" while entering the line of code that 
follows, from the next lecture:
var post = <%- JSON.stringify(post) %>;

Then add "html.validate.scripts": false to the users
 settings.json file and that should fix the issue.
